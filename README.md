# UnidenProgrammer
This is a simple programmer for channels for an Uniden UBC75XLT.

As I didn't find a free alternative, I decided to create this myself.
This programmer is built for an Uniden UBC75XLT, but with small modifications it should also work for other models. (I hardcoded 10 banks, 30 channels each)
The protocol I used is described in http://info.uniden.com/twiki/pub/UnidenMan4/BC75XLT/BC75XLT_Protocol.pdf
